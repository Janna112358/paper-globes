We want to project spherical images onto a polyhedron (e.g. icosahedron) and make a printable net of the surfaces of the polyhedron that you can cut out and fold/paste together to get some sort of paper globe.

An idea for the projection of the spherical image onto polyhedron surfaces exists (see https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/polypics/).

Ideas for images: map of constellations (map points and maybe lines)
sky map of some data, for example LIGO sky localisation of a gravitational wave event.

Also needed is some way to "print" the surfaces of the polyhedra, and arrange them as a net that can be folded together once printed out. Would be nice to add some edged that can be used to glue the thing together.

A description of our icosahedron in 3D:
vertices A (g, 1, 0)
	 B (-g, 1, 0)
	 C (g, -1, 0)
	 D (-g, -1, 0)
	 E (1, 0, g)
	 F (-1, 0, g)
	 G (1, 0, -g)
	 H (-1, 0, -g)
	 I (0, g, 1)
	 J (0, -g, 1)
	 K (0, g, -1)
	 L (0, -g, -1)
Where g is the golden ratio (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.

The 20 surfaces are formed by sets of 3 vertices. To know which, see icosahedron_naming.png. This identifies each surface by a number (roman numerals). All 30 edges are named with numbers as well (and you can see which ones should be pasted together).

A local coordinate system is defined on each of the surfaces (a 2D one), so we know where to print points eventually. The convention for this is as follow: There is a set order to the vertices of each face; starting with the top (down) one for right-side-up (up-side-down) triangles in the net, and going around anti-clockwise. The first unit vector u goes from the middle of the triangle to the first vertex. Then, the second unit vector is the cross product of u and the normal on the plane.
