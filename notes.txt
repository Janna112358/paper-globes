We want to project spherical images onto a polyhedron (e.g. icosahedron) and make a printable net of the surfaces of the polyhedron that you can cut out and fold/paste together to get some sort of paper globe.

An idea for the projection of the spherical image onto polyhedron surfaces exists (see https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/polypics/), but a description of the surfaces in a 3D coordinate system is needed.

Ideas for images: map of constellations (map points and maybe lines)
sky map of some data, for example LIGO sky localisation of a GW event

Also needed is some way to "print" the surfaces of the polyhedra, and arrange them as a net that can be folded together once printed out. Would be nice to add some edged that can be used to glue the thing together.
